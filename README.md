# intro_to_data_science_260
All assignments for BST 260: Introduction to Data Science.

Shared with permission from the course instructor.

This class focuses on the fundamentals of data science with applications in R. From this class, I obtained valuable skills in data wrangling, data visualization, _shiny_ applications, probability and inference, regression, and machine learning. I rigorously practiced these skills by completing the course assignments with great attention to effective results communication to everyday audiences.

For privacy concerns, I cannot release any datasets that are not already publicly available. However, I have uploaded all of the code and results to demonstrate the content taught in the class and the skills I have acquired.
